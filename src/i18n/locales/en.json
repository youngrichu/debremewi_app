    "intro": "Dubai Debre Mewie St. Michael and St. Arsema Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is one of the parishes within the Diocese of Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, and the Middle East of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Our church, located in Oud Metha, Dubai, serves God through covenant prayers, Qidase (Divine Liturgy), Mahlet, and daily preaching of the Word of God, just like any other Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church parish, in a manner that suits the location and the congregation. To facilitate its services, it has a seven-section structure: Bete Wulud (Children and Youth Section), Bete Arde'it (Higher Education Students Section), Bete Kebre Kidusan (Kebre Kidusan Sunday School Section), Bete Tswa (Tswa Associations Section), Bete Seb'i (Parents and Married Couples Section), Bete Sebeka (Parish Council Service Section), and Bete Kahnat (Clergy Association Service Section). Through these structures, day and night, it seeks the intercession of the angels and the grace of God, preaching the Gospel among Christians, calling those who have not heard, and working to bring Christ to the world.",
